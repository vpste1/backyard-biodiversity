            <h2>Why it's important</h2>
            <p>
              Biodiversity facilitates healthy ecosystems, and healthy
              ecosystems increase many of the natural services we rely on;
              including clean water, air, healthy soil and diversity of food
              sources.
              <br />
              <br />
              As city landscapes grow, available green spaces are decreasing -
              biodiversity levels are dropping and many plant and animal species
              that we rely on are losing their homes.
            </p>

          <div className={`${styles.textBox} ${styles.right}`}>
            <h2>Backyard biodiversity</h2>
            <p>
              Biodiversity can do great things in your backyard!
              <br />
              <br />
              Urban backyards large or small can help increase levels of
              biodiversity, wildlife species and support healthy ecosystems with
              just a few select garden choices.
